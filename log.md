# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 2, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started (and completed about 90% of) simple app that selects a random set of hex values and sets the background of the container to a gradient of the two values and sets the background of two divs to the first and last of the values. There's a refresh button to select a new set of values.

**Thoughts:** When the page first loads it's blank, so I need to either run the setNewColors function on page load, or provide inital values.

**Link to work:** [Color Generator (though that's not really what it is - I need a better name!)](https://github.com/joshbivens/bgcolorgen)
