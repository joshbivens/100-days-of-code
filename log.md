# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 2nd, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Started (and completed about 90% of) simple app that selects a random set of hex values and sets the background of the container to a gradient of the two values and sets the background of two divs to the first and last of the values. There's a refresh button to select a new set of values.

**Thoughts:** When the page first loads it's blank, so I need to either run the setNewColors function on page load, or provide inital values.

### Day 2: January 3rd, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Added info cards for the seperate color divs and the gradient. I'd say it done.

**Thoughts:** Very simple, but I wanted to figure out how to do this so that I can use it in a bigger app I have planned. Also, using higher order functions is becoming natural to me which is very cool.

### Day 2.5: January 3rd, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Started Tic-Tac-Toe game and it's deceptively complex. Got as far as making the game board and superficially setting the text of the space you clicked on to "X".

**Thoughts:** I need to figure out how the array of subarrays I've set up to house the data for each space relates to the HTML that I return from mapping it to produce the game board.
